      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to end the silence â€“ with &amp;ldquo;Silence&amp;rdquo;!
Today I released &amp;ldquo;Silence&amp;rdquo;, a song I started a long time ago and which accompanied me for quite some time now.
In February 2015 during FAWM I came across these beautiful lyrics written by Elizabeth Petty. Liz is well known for her amazingly beautiful and well crafted lyric, and I was lucky enough to get the chance to put this to music.</description>

      <description>Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s get started. I&amp;rsquo;ll release the first song on May the 9th. The song is a collaboration between the talented Nadine de Macedo, songwriter, producer and remixer of pop, rock and electronic music based in Germany, and me.
It all started in February this year during FAWM where I left an instrumental called Sleepless without knowing what to do with it. And then, Nadine came up with lyrics, and helped me tweaking the arrangement to make it a short and catchy song.</description>
