      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to end the silence â€“ with &amp;ldquo;Silence&amp;rdquo;!
Today I released &amp;ldquo;Silence&amp;rdquo;, a song I started a long time ago and which accompanied me for quite some time now.
In February 2015 during FAWM I came across these beautiful lyrics written by Elizabeth Petty. Liz is well known for her amazingly beautiful and well crafted lyric, and I was lucky enough to get the chance to put this to music.</description>
