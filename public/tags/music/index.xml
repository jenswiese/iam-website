      <description>Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s get started. I&amp;rsquo;ll release the first song on May the 9th. The song is a collaboration between the talented Nadine de Macedo, songwriter, producer and remixer of pop, rock and electronic music based in Germany, and me.
It all started in February this year at FAWM where I left an instrumental called Sleepless without knowing what to do with it. And then, Nadine came up with lyrics, and helped me tweaking the arrangement to make it a short and catchy song.</description>
