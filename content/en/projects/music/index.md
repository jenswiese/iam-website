I like a lot of different genres, and actually I'm not tied to a specific one when it comes to make music. My project **The Analog Outfit**
is about electronic music of all kind. I do minimal techno tracks, and electronic as well. You can find all about it on Soundcloud.
The project is not dead yet, I actually have some tracks on hold, because I focus on **I AM MEADOWS** right now.
