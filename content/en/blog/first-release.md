Okay, let's get started. I'll release the first song on May the 9th. The song is a collaboration between the talented **Nadine de Macedo**, songwriter, producer and remixer of pop, rock and electronic music based in Germany, and
me.

It all started in February this year during [FAWM](https://fawm.org) where I left an instrumental called **Sleepless** without knowing what to do with it. And then, Nadine came up with lyrics, and helped me tweaking the arrangement to make it a short and catchy song. 

And you can listen to **Sleepless** on May the 9th. Stay tuned, I'll keep you posted!

By the way, you can listen to **Nadines** music on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/nadinedemacedo), and follow her on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nadinedemacedo).
