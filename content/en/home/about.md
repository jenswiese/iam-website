My name is Jens! I'm a musician, producer and step sequencer enthusiast.

I AM MEADOWS is my approach to bring my favorite genres together â€“ with almost no restrictions. 
Meaning: Synth meets guitar meets 808 meets jaw harp meets whatever!

Let's see how this goes. :)

Currently you can listen to my music on:

- [Bandcamp](https://iammeadows.bandcamp.com/),
- [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/iammeadows) and of course on
- [FAWM](https://fawm.org/fawmers/meadows) (if available),

If you like what you hear, please let me know.
